The first upload of Anonymous Tales had various bugs. This bugs caused poor user experience. I fixed the problem involving otp-verification and redirect to log in form, so far it works great. For the server, currently using onrender. The server host usually has a downtime of 15 min -> if the server has not been used within 15 min it will stop functioning for a while...i fixed this on atales-bugfix-0.0.1 : By LightOne
